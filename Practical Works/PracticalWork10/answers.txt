List:
- An ordered collection
- Allow elements to be repeated
- Element  are accessed using their index, like 0/1/2 etc
Set (HashSet):
- Does not allow duplicate elements
- Does not guarantee any specific order
- internally uses hashing, making add, search and remove operations generally fast

Map ( hashmap)
- stores data in key–value pairs
- keys must be unique, but values can be duplicated
- provides very fast lookups by key using hashing

Stack (LIFO Stack):
- "Last In, First Out": the most recently added item is the first to be removed
- Common operations include:
    -> push (to add an item )
    -> pop (to remove the top item)
    -> peek( to view the top item without removing it )

Queue (FIFO Queue):
- "Firstt In, First Out": the earliest added item is removed first
- Common operations include
    ->  add or offer (to add to the end)
    -> remove or poll (to remove from the front)
    -> peek (to view the item at the front)
Deque:
-A double-ended queue
- Alows adding and removing items from both the front and back
- Can act like a stack  using one end or a queue using both ends
